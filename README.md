# kv_bot

## Project Overview

`kv_bot` is a comprehensive robotics system designed for automated navigation, environment interaction, and task execution in simulated environments. This project leverages ROS (Robot Operating System) to enable autonomous operations, sensor integration, and real-time control of robotic systems. It is intended to serve as a versatile template for developing advanced robotics applications.

## Key Functionalities

### 1. Autonomous Navigation
- The robot is equipped with navigation capabilities that allow it to autonomously explore its environment. Utilizing a combination of sensor data and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), the robot can build a map of its surroundings and navigate to designated waypoints.
- **Core Components**:
  - **Laser Scanners**: Detect obstacles and generate real-time 2D maps.
  - **Path Planning Algorithms**: Compute optimal paths using ROS navigation stack.

### 2. Environment Interaction
- The robot can interact with the environment, detecting and responding to various stimuli through its sensor suite. This includes object recognition, obstacle avoidance, and responding to dynamic changes in the surroundings.
- **Core Components**:
  - **RGB-D Camera**: Provides depth data for 3D perception.
  - **Object Detection Module**: Identifies and classifies objects using machine learning models.

### 3. Simulation Environment
- The project includes a fully simulated environment using Gazebo, allowing for extensive testing and development without the need for physical hardware. The simulated world can be customized to replicate various scenarios, making it ideal for testing navigation, object detection, and other functionalities.
- **Core Components**:
  - **Gazebo World Files**: Pre-configured worlds for testing various robot behaviors.
  - **Robot Models**: URDF/Xacro files that define the robot’s physical structure and capabilities.

### 4. Modular Design
- The system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and integration of additional features. This modular approach simplifies debugging, maintenance, and future enhancements.
- **Core Components**:
  - **ROS Nodes**: Separate nodes for different functionalities such as navigation, control, and perception.
  - **Dynamic Parameter Tuning**: Enables on-the-fly adjustments to optimize performance.

## Core Algorithms and Techniques

### 1. Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance
- Implements algorithms like A* and Dijkstra for efficient path planning.
- Utilizes the ROS `move_base` package to dynamically avoid obstacles using sensor feedback.

### 2. SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Uses GMapping or Hector SLAM to generate a real-time map of the environment.
- Continuously updates the robot's position using sensor data fusion (IMU, Lidar, Odometry).

### 3. Computer Vision for Object Detection
- Integrates OpenCV and TensorFlow models for real-time object detection.
- Recognizes specific objects and responds with predefined actions (e.g., picking, avoiding, or logging).

## System Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The robot boots up and initializes all sensors, including Lidar, RGB-D Camera, and IMU.
   
2. **Mapping & Localization**:
   - The SLAM node starts to generate a real-time map while the robot localizes itself within that map.
   
3. **Path Planning**:
   - Based on the mapped environment, the robot calculates the optimal path to reach the desired target while avoiding obstacles.
   
4. **Object Detection**:
   - The camera feed is processed using computer vision algorithms to detect objects and respond accordingly.

## Use Cases

- **Industrial Automation**: Deployed in factory settings for automated inspection and material handling.
- **Surveillance and Monitoring**: Ideal for patrolling and monitoring secured facilities, detecting anomalies in real-time.
- **Research and Development**: A robust platform for testing new robotics algorithms.

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Command Integration**: Adding voice control for hands-free operation. This has been happening in the side we achieved voice control using ESP32.
- **Advanced AI Capabilities**: Implementing reinforcement learning for better decision-making in dynamic environments. Along with this Opencv capabilities are being enhanced by trying to implement sematic segmentation from the pi camera output.
- **Enhanced Mobility**: Exploring legged locomotion for navigating uneven terrains.
- **New Chasis being built**: Exploring six-wheel drive and legged locomotion for handling uneven and irregular terrain.
